|  An attempt to create a formatted song lyrics/discography file.
|  Special characters (only significant in first column; handle them
|  properly or ignore rest of line):
|
|  \  precedes album/period id
|  #  precedes song id
|  |  precedes comment
|  *  precedes item comments
|
|  album_id => 2 characters  (e.g. 17 or cB)
|  song_id  => 3 characters  (e.g. 023 or 1FC)
|  comment  => n characters
|  reference => album_id song_id (e.g. 17023 or cB1FC)
|
|  Everything between the #song_id and the next #song_id or \album_id is
|  lyrics, except lines starting with special characters. Song and album names
|  should be unambiguous. If you enter a new album containing a song that's
|  already somewhere else in the file, DO NOT copy-and-paste the lyrics - just
|  leave it empty.
|
|  Item comments are used to store additional information about an album
|  or a song, i.e. year of release, liner notes, reviews... Item comments about
|  an album should appear right after the \album_id, before the first #song_id.
|  Item comments about songs should appear right after the respective #song_id,
|  before the lyrics.
|  Song_ids start with 1 if the respective songs are "period" songs, i.e.
|  not released on the album. These songs should be listed _after_ any
|  album songs.
|
|
|  EXAMPLE:
|
|  \00The First, Never Released, Top Secret Album
|  *This album featuring Neil Young with Frank Sinatra was never released,
|  *apparently due to legal problems with David Geffen.
|  #000T-Bone
|  *A masterpiece of contemporary poetry!
|  got mashed potatoes
|  ain't got no t-bone
|  #101Northern Alaska Brings Me Down
|  *This song can be found on "Lucky Seventeen".
|  | empty because the song can be found on another album!
|  \01Lucky Seventeen
|  #000Northern Alaska Brings Me Down
|  the sixties are gone
|  and so are all my friends...
